BrewingDB V1

Overview: This tool provides a simple GUI interface for creating cloning and editing brewing recipes. 

Installation: Tested and working on python 3.9.4. Uses commonly prepacked tkinter and sqlite3 libraries. If python 3.9.4 was installed using default options, then the program should run with no further installation.

Startup: Prior to running the program for the first time run “DatabaseInit.py” to setup the database. Type “Y“ then press enter to accept the confirmation prompt and your clean database will be created. NB: Rerunning “DatabaseInit.py” and accepting the prompt a second time will reset the database! To insert an example record run “MakeExample.py” which will insert an example recipe into the database. Finally, run BrewingDatabase.py to start the program.
On subsequent runs only BrewingDatabase.py needs to be run to start the program.

Happy Brewing!
